<h1>About OCR</h1>
<p>OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology that extracts the text from an image or a scanned document so that it can be edited, formatted, searched, indexed, automatically translated or converted to speech.
OCR can be used to convert books, invoices and other documents into electronic format and to automate various business processes.
It's time to stop retyping. Just scan and OCR.</p>
